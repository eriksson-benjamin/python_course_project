# python_course_project

For my PhD project work I have developed a data analysis code which reads data from a server, performs data analysis on the data and plots a time-of-flight spectrum for a given experiment at the Joint European Torus (JET) in England. In cases where the experiment has generated large data files, the code has issues with speed. The aim of this project is to increase the speed of the code for large data files. The secondary aim of the project is to start writing docstrings for the functions used in the analysis. The tertiary aim of the project is to set up the possibility of using GitHub on the data cluster from which I run the code.

The project is described in more detail in project_report.pdf.
